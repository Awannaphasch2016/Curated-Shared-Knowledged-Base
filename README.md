# Curated-Shared-Knowledged-Base

## Project name: Garun

In thai, Garun is a symbol that is used to silence pronunciation of certain letters that are hard/awkward to pronouce. In the other word, Garun unify pronunciation on how words from different origin should sound in Thai.

This is equivalent of the project attempt to unify "note taking" system for research to maximize searchbility and allow for collaboration.

## About the Project
[Question] what is the goal of the project?
[Answer] the goal of the project is to create and maintain an active community to collaborate on creating "knowledge base" with the focus on machine learning/deep learning/ai for research.

In short, we attempt to create platform to curated notes ( in "Evergreenote" and "Seedling" style) while increase content searchability. 

Ultimately, the goal is to create a completely distributed/parallel collaboration where users/members need not know each other nor need not directly message each other to collaborate. (Similar to pull request functionality from Github)

 -----------------------------
[Question] Why don't you use Github to open source this project?
[Answer] using github, searchability aspect of the project must be developed. (Both: logical query + word query)

I acknowledge that version control is a desired properties in which our Shared Knowledge project lacks. 

There are open source project that have similar functionality to roam research that allow for the use of version control.  However, it lacks logical query which allow roam research to implement completely distributed collaboration.

------------------------------
[Question] How is the project different from Wikipedia?

[Answer] If Wikipedia is a second brain for people who use internet. 
This project's goal is to be a second brain for researcher.

------------------
[Question] Where can I learn about collaboration mechanism for this project?

[Answer] see getting-started text channel.

--------------------
[Question] who is the project for?

[Answer] Since the project is still in "development," our target is  focus on people who have Research + AI experience.

---------------------
[Question] What is the platform that content will be curated?

[Answer] As of 10/13/2020, roam research is the only possible option that I can make the collaboration idea possible. However, in the future, platform maybe subject to change to "form-bubble" (open-source project)

--------------------
[Question] How can I be a part of the project?

[Answer] To become a member and keep your access to the shared knowledge base.  You must gain "active" member position. There are 2 positions (10/13/2020) "active" and "non-active" see "contribution" text channel for more information of how "active" and "non-active" are defined. If you stay in "non-active" for a certain period of time. you will lose access to the shared knowledge base , and will eventually be removed of the project. The reason for this is that in a new project, it is always preferred to have few active members rather than  many non-active members. Also, it creates healthy community where members share similar passion.

## Project Milestone
[]  3-4 active members by 10/31/2020.
[]  10 active members by 12/31/2020.
[]  In the best case scenario, 30-40 active members before 12/31/2020.

## How can I contribute?

[info] To contribute, member need to maintain "active" position. There are 2 positions: "active" and "non-active." Active status could be defined per member. (it is to acknowledge the fact that people who are enthusiastic about the project may be busy with other tasks they are previously involved in. We want to keep this type of people. )
In general, member is considered to be "active" if he/she contribute to summarizing 1 paper/week. (Definition of "active" is subjective to change.) Otherwise, member is qualified as "non-active."
[info] member who maintain"non-active" for a certain period of time will be removed of the project and lose their access to the knowledge base.
